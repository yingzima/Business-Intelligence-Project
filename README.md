# Business Intelligence Project

The BI project team used the following underlying objectives to ground their project work, analysis and recommendations:

- Design and develop a unified database to help XXX Insurance Company collect and analyze data regarding their lead conversion and client retention efforts.
- Design and develop reports and dashboard(s) that illustrate the quality of leads and prioritize those of higher quality and importance to the company.
- Collect retention data (both in facts and attributes) to draw insights about loyal customers and risks of non-renewals or non-payments and integrate those across retention practices.
- Identify KPIâ€™s and assess the effectiveness of their newly implemented lead scoring effort compared to a partner metric
